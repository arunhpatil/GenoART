# GenoART
GenoART is a standalone application for detecting coding potential of transcripts complemented by experimentally derived proteomics (MS/MS) data. GenoART will make use of Python, PERL and javascripts for processing your input genome and create a custom database for proteogenomic searches. A detailed protocol is available online. In simple terms, the custom database generated by this application can be used as a reference protein database and search the unmatched/unassigned spectra in any search engines such as Mascot, SEQUEST, X! Tandem or Andromeda. GenoART can be queried to categorize and browse these resultant peptides at the click of a button. The peptides will include the genomic coordinates which allows user to navigate to UCSC genome browser which can facilitate more details about the gene/transcript and can be compaired with predicted genes, Expressed sequence Tag (EST), and perform comparitive genomics for more evidence. A GTF (Gene Transfer Format) will be available to download upon querying, which can later be viewed in any genome visualizer such as UCSC or IGV to compare accross different studies.
